# ShareMarks

ShareMarks is a web application to share and favorite bookmarks with many different users.

## Getting Started

The project is fairly simple to get started with. First, you need to get Ruby version 2.2.1 and Rails version 4.2.5. Those should be the only development side requirements.

### Installing

Once you have that, you should be able to get a copy of the repository by forking it.

The project will be loaded using the Rails server and opening the local server in a browser.

```
rails s
```

You should see this:

```
=> Booting WEBrick
=> Rails 4.2.5 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for m
```

## Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - The web framework used
